# BlackJackBasicStrategySimulator
A Black Jack Simulator to measure the effectiveness of Basic Strategy and Counting Card on the players net income.

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Motivation

The Blackjack Basic Strategy Simulator will be used to practice both basic strategy and basic card counting. It will analyze loses and gains over several trials to determine how the players and dealers win and lose. 

## Installation and Usage
